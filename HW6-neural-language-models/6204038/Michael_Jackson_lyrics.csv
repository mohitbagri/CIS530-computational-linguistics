Michael Jackson,25 Miles,/m/michael+jackson/25+miles_20092835.html,"Twenty-five miles from home, girl  
My feet are hurtin' mighty bad  
Now I've been walkin' for three days  
And two lonely nights  
You know that I'm mighty bad  
But I got a girl waitin' for me  
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile  
You see, she's got the kind  
Of lovin' and kissin'  
Make a boy go stone wild  
  
I got to keep on walkin'  
Oh I got to walk on  
Let me tell you, y'all  
I'm so tired  
But I just can't lose my stride  
  
I got fifteen miles to go now  
And I can hear my baby callin' my name  
It's as if, as though  
I'm standin' at her front door  
And I can hear that doggone thing  
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby  
And hold her in my arms one more time  
And when I kiss her lips  
I turn backward flip  
And I forget about these feet of mine  
  
I got to keep on walkin'  
Oh I got to walk on  
Let me tell you, y'all  
I'm so tired  
But I just can't lose my stride  
  
Yeah I got to walk on  
Let me tell you, y'all  
Hope my feet don't fail me now  
I got five more miles to go  
I got nine, eight, seven  
Six, oh six  
  
I got five more miles to go now  
Over the hills just around the bend  
Although my feet are tired  
I can't lose my stride  
I got to get my baby back again  
  
I got to keep on walkin'  
I got to walk on  
Let me tell y'all  
I'm so tired now  
But I just can't lose my stride  
Oh, I got to walk on  
Let me tell you now  
I'm so tired  
But I just can't lose my stride  
I got to walk on

Living in the shadows  
Walking only in night-time  
Outside

Sick and tired of this all  
But I'm not gonna begg

You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa claus is coming to town (3x)

And checkin' it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa claus is coming to town (3x)  
  
People making list  
Buying special gifts,  
Taking time to be kind to one and all  
It's the time of year  
When good friends are dear  
And you wish you could give more than just presents from the store  
Why don't you give love on christmas day (on christmas day)  
Oh, even the man who has everything  
Would be so happy if you would bring  
Give love on christmas day (on christmas day)  
No greater gift is there than love  
  
Someday at x'mas  
Men won't boys playin with bombs like kids play with toys  
One warm december our heart will see  
A world where men are free  
Someday at x'mas  
There'll be no wars when we have what x'mas is for  
When we have found what life's really worth  
There'll be peace on earth  
Someday at x'mas  
We'll see a land  
No hungry children no empty hand  
One happy morning People will share  
A world where people care  
  
I saw mommy kissing santa claus  
Underneath a mistle toe last night  
She didn't see me creep down the stairs to have a peep  
She tought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
Then I saw mommy tickle santa claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
Oh what a laugh it would have been if daddy had only seen  
Mommy kissing santa claus last night  
  
Come they told me parapapampam (rapapampam)  
A new born king to see parapapampam (rapapampam)  
Our finest gifts to bring parapapampam (rapapampam)  
To lay before the king parapapampam rapapampam rapapampam  
Soul to honor him parapapampam (rapapampam)  
When we come (when we come)

This thing can't go wrong  
  
This feeling's so strong  
  
Well, my life ain't worth living  
  
If I can't be with you  
I just can't stop loving you  
I just can't stop loving you  
And if I stop  
Then tell me, just what will I do  
  
I just can't stop loving you  
  
We can change all the world tomorrow  
We can sing songs of yesterday  
I can say, hey farewell to sorrow  
This is my life and I,  
Want to see you for always  
  
I just can't stop loving you  
I just can't stop loving you  
If I can't stop!  
And if I stop

Is one long sleepless night  
Let me show you girl  
That I know wrong from right  
Every street you walk on  
I lay tear stains on the ground  
Following the girl  
I didn't even want you around

Folks would know, they'd know

Nobody have a need to pray  
Except for thanking me

That everywhere beneath the sun

All night, all night

Each time I do they kind of burn right through me  
Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies  
And yet my heart is saying come and do me

Now we're just a web of mystery  
A possibility of more to come  
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be  
But here I go falling again

It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high

Michael Jackson,Little Susie,/m/michael+jackson/little+susie_20092712.html,"Somebody killed little Susie  
The girl with the tune  
Who sings in the daytime at noon  
She was there screaming  
Beating her voice in her doom  
But nobody came to her soon  
  
A fall down the stairs  
Her dress torn  
Oh the blood in her hair  
A mystery so sullen in air  
She lie there so tenderly  
Fashioned so slenderly  
Lift her with care,  
Oh the blood in her hair  
  
Everyone came to see  
The girl that now is dead  
So blind stare the eyes in her head  
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said  
This girl lived in vain  
Her face bear such agony, such strain  
  
But only the man from next door  
Knew Little Susie and how he cried  
As he reached down  
To close Susie's eyes  
She lie there so tenderly  
Fashioned so slenderly  
Lift her with care  
Oh the blood in her hair  
  
It was all for God's sake  
For her singing the tune  
For someone to feel her despair  
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed  
Then to scream out  
And nobody's there  
  
She knew no one cared  
  
Father left home, poor mother died  
Leaving Susie alone  
Grandfather's soul too had flown  
No one to care  
Just to love her  
How much can one bear  
Rejecting the needs in her prayers  
  
Neglection can kill  
Like a knife in your soul  
Oh it will  
Little Susie fought so hard to live  
She lie there so tenderly  
Fashioned so slenderly  
Lift her with care  
So young and so fair
