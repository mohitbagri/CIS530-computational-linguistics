For part II:

Leaderboard implementation:
    --language_model_NN_adaptive_learning_rate.ipynb language_model_NN_adaptive_learning_rate.py

Writeup version:
    --language_model_RNN_writeup_process.ipynb language_model_RNN_writeup_process.py
are for losses (of both training set and validation set) versus time.
    --LearningRate_plot.py
is for plotting losses for various learning rates.
    --language_model_NN_LSTM.ipynb language_model_NN_LSTM.py
are for LSTM's attempts (we can also provide GRU as well, however both are not successful).

For part III:
    --generate_text_MJ.py generate_text_MJ.ipynb
are generating Michael Jackson's lyrics with

    --Michael_Jackson_lyrics.csv

the training set.
